                    <p>As a team, we were challenged to create a mobile application that focused on meeting an unmet need for consumers.

                    <p>One of the most common problems for homeowners are endless home improvement projects. The decision whether or not to hire a contractor is also common. Along with endless trips to the home improvement store resulting often being over budget. 
                    </p>    
                    <p>DIY’ers need a way to quickly estimate the scope of common home improvement projects because they lack the experience and often end up frustrated with costly and unfinished projects.</p>

                <p>As we dove into our primary research, we wanted to determine why homeowners sought to hire a contractor and what factors helped then determine when they should start a new DIY project within their homes.
                </p>        
                <p>We quickly realized that the reasoning behind starting a DIY project was not to fix non-working items, but for personal satisfaction.
                </p>    
                <p>Our DIY’ers were young and frugal. They were tech-savvy and preferred to learn a new skill in an online tutorial. Our homeowners could easily determine cost/benefit analysis and realized that they easily save by completing the home improvement project themselves.
                </p>    
                <p>Many projects took more time and money than expected, but our DIY’ers are determined to do it themselves! We developed our persona, Robert Paulson below based on our research findings.

                <p>Our key user insight was learning that our homeowners did not want to hire a contractor—they felt satisfaction in completing the project on their own. At this point, we changed the objective of our application from “should I hire a contractor” to providing the DIY’er with all of the information needed to start a DIY project. </p>

                <p>For ideation, we completed a competitor analysis, created an affinity diagram based on user insights, and created a feature prioritization matrix. Key findings for DIY’ers included: they need a specific material list before entering a home improvement store, they like to share their finished projects with friends, and they would like to consider the entire scope of the project before beginning.</p>

                <p>As you can see on the feature prioritization matrix below, we decided to include the features that both had the greatest impact and the lowest complexity in our MVP, such as a cost calculator and a project-type filter. </p>

                <p>Based on the findings in the definition stage, we designed basic wireframes with the features that our independent and frugal DIY’er would use while planning a home improvement project including  trending home improvement projects, a share screen so you can take pictures of your finished project and share on any social media app, and filters to make selecting your next DIY project enjoyable.</p> 
                <p>We also created a user flow to define how our DIY’er would interact with the application and use each tool. We deducted that our DIY’er would spend time searching popular home repair projects before deciding to watch a tutorial or create a material list.</p>
                <p>Our initial usability tests indicated that users found the material list confusing and difficult to use so we restructured the user flow created a separate screen for this function.</p>

We also took our main project pages and linked them to allow participants to access the learning area from one central page. The learning (explore) page was also streamlines after testing showed that the products were not developed fully enough for the users to understand.
                    </p>        
                    <p>After additional testing, we realized our product needed more iterations and further testing. As with all product design, continuous improvement is always needed. We learned that testing early and often is imperative to developing a functional and usable application.
